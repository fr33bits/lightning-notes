# Lightning Notes

Lightning Notes is a quick note-taking app based on a chat-like user interface. But it goes beyond the "Note to Self" functionality found in many messaging apps as it also allows for the use of channels for organizing your notes and sharing them with others. You can also tag your notes or only share a web link.

The app uses GitHub pages as its front-end while the data is stored in and synced between all devices you are signed into using a Firebase Firestore database.

## Deployment

A GitHub Pages deployment of the app can be accessed at [https://fr33bits.github.io/lightning-notes/](https://fr33bits.github.io/lightning-notes/).

The client can also be deployed locally:

1. Open the CLI in the directory where you want the project.
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/fr33bits/lightning-notes.git`.
3. Install the necessary packages by running the `npm i` command.
4. Set up a development server using the `npm serve`command.
5. A new browser window should open with the app.

## Known issues and work in progress
